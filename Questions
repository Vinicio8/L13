A1.
Move semantics allow efficient transfer of resources between objects, avoiding expensive copies. They work by stealing resources from source objects that are about to be destroyed or reassigned.

A2.
Performance-critical applications.
Code that handles large data structures (vectors, strings, custom buffers).

A3.
Using a moved-from object in an unspecified state.
Moving objects that don't properly implement move semantics.
